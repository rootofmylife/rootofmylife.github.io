# Introduction

There are 2 kinds of programing languages:

- [Imperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming): Imperative languages focus on how a problem is solved, using sequences of instructions to manipulate state. There are multiple reasons for their popularity. They are easy to understand and can be used to solve a wide range of problems. They are also efficient and can be used to write high-performance code.
- [Declarative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming): This focuses on describing what the problem or desired outcome is, rather than how to achieve it. This is a higher level of abstraction that allows the programmer to focus on the problem rather than the solution. This can make the code easier to understand and maintain.
  - There are entire paradigms of actual general purpose programming languages that are declarative. The main two of these are [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) and [logic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_programming).

Prolog is a declarative programming language. It is based on the logic programming paradigm. It is a general-purpose language often associated with artificial intelligence and computational linguistics.

> The only basic language constructs in Prolog are facts, rules, and queries. These are composed of logical combinations of predicates. Simply put: a fact is something that is inherently true in your program, a rule is a conditional relation "if A is true, then B is true", and a query is anything we would like to have answered according to the facts and rules in our system. Prolog finds the answers to these queries through unification, which is a sort of fancy [pattern matching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_matching).
