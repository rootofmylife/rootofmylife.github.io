# Pollyfill and Transpilers

## Transpilers

A [transpiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-to-source_compiler) is a special piece of software that translates source code to another source code. It can parse (“read and understand”) modern code and rewrite it using older syntax constructs, so that it’ll also work in outdated engines.

E.g. JavaScript before year 2020 didn’t have the “nullish coalescing operator” `??`. So, if a visitor uses an outdated browser, it may fail to understand the code like `height = height ?? 100`.

A transpiler would analyze our code and rewrite `height ?? 100` into `(height !== undefined && height !== null) ? height : 100`.

```javascript
// before running the transpiler
height = height ?? 100;

// after running the transpiler
height = height !== undefined && height !== null ? height : 100;
```

Now the rewritten code is suitable for older JavaScript engines.

Usually, a developer runs the transpiler on their own computer, and then deploys the transpiled code to the server.

Speaking of names, [Babel](https://babeljs.io) is one of the most prominent transpilers out there.

Modern project build systems, such as [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), provide a means to run a transpiler automatically on every code change, so it’s very easy to integrate into the development process.

## Polyfills

New language features may include not only syntax constructs and operators, but also built-in functions.

For example, `Math.trunc(n)` is a function that “cuts off” the decimal part of a number, e.g `Math.trunc(1.23)` returns `1`.

In some (very outdated) JavaScript engines, there’s no `Math.trunc`, so such code will fail.

As we’re talking about new functions, not syntax changes, there’s no need to transpile anything here. We just need to declare the missing function.

A script that updates/adds new functions is called “polyfill”. It “fills in” the gap and adds missing implementations.

For this particular case, the polyfill for `Math.trunc` is a script that implements it, like this:

```javascript
if (!Math.trunc) {
  // if no such function
  // implement it
  Math.trunc = function (number) {
    // Math.ceil and Math.floor exist even in ancient JavaScript engines
    // they are covered later in the tutorial
    return number < 0 ? Math.ceil(number) : Math.floor(number);
  };
}
```

JavaScript is a highly dynamic language. Scripts may add/modify any function, even built-in ones.

Two interesting polyfill libraries are:

- [core js](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js) that supports a lot, allows to include only needed features.
