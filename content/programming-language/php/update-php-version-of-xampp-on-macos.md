# Update PHP version of XAMPP on macOS

1. Go to your localhost PHPmyAdmin, click on "Export" and export all the databases as one.
2. Go to your XAMPP folder, go to the "Htdocs" folder and copy all your project files to a different folder outside the XAMPP folder.
3. Go to the XAMPP folder and click the uninstall icon. It will remove xampp. I noticed it leaves your database and htdocs folder intact. Steps 1 and 2 were just a precaution.
4. Go to and download the latest XAMPP that has the PHP version you want. You can find it atÂ [https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)
5. Click on the downloaded file and install it. It will complete and you will have the PHP version you want install and your Htdocs and database will be intact. In case your database and htdocs is not there, simply recopy the project files you copied and import the database you exported.
