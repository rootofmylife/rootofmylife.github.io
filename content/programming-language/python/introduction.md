# Introduction

Python is an object-oriented language.

All of the basic data types (integers, strings, lists, dictionaries, etc) are examples of "objects".

Objects involve data and a set of "methods" that carry out operations on the data.

```python
# a is a string object
a = "Hello, World!"
# a has a method called upper()
print(a.upper())
```

## Data Structures

Python has several built-in data structures:

- Tuple (immutable)
- Dictionary
- Class instance (open file `class/1_data_structure.md` for more information)
- List
- Set
