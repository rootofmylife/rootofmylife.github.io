# Refactor Rules

A good refactor does not change behaviour

Tips:

1. Be incremental: Make small, manageable changes rather than sweeping rewrites.
2. Deeply understand code before doing significant refactors or new abstractions.
3. Match the existing code style: Consistency is key for maintainability.
4. Avoid too many new abstractions: Keep it simple unless complexity is truly warranted.
5. Avoid adding new libraries, especially of a very different programming style, without buy-in from the team.
6. Write tests before refactoring and update them as you go. This ensures you're maintaining the original functionality.
7. Hold your coworkers accountable to these principles.
