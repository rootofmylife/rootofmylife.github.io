# Math Books

_Basic Mathematics_ by Lang. Covers basic algebra and geometry at high school level.

_Vector Calculus, Linear Algebra and Differential Forms_ by Hubbard and Hubbard. Takes you through linear algebra, single-variable calculus and multiple variable calculus. Analysis is discussed in an appendix. All proofs have a constructive bias, so it's very algorithmic and natural for a CS-minded student. Solutions are in a separate volume.

_Program = Proof_ by Mimram. Discusses logic and computation, and takes you from the basics to depedent type theory and beyond. Uses OCaml and Agda. Freely available at: [https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Samuel.Mimram/teaching...](https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Samuel.Mimram/teaching/INF551/course.pdf)

"Thinking mathematically" by J. Mason, L. Burton and K. Stacey

Linear Algebra Done Right by Sheldon Axler
Linear Algebra Done Right by Sheldon Axler is indeed a good book if you are looking for a rigorous proof based book to learn linear algebra.
Here [1] you can find Sheldon Axler himself explaining the topics of the book in his YouTube channel! How wonderful is that!
Here [2] you can find the solutions to the exercises in the book.
This [3] Lectures might help as well, among the books this course follow is Algebra Done Right.
Good luck learning the subject of Linear Algebra you'll have fun doing so.

Statistics by Freedman, Pisani and Purves. Don't know if I got better but loved the real world examples and cartoons. Does not have too many pre-requisites. Each section presents a tiny concept which is followed by plenty of exercises that have answers at the end. The furthest I got in a book in recent days, Math or not.

The Language of Mathematics: Utilizing Math in Practice by Baber

How to Solve It: A New Aspect of Mathematical Method (Princeton Science Library) by G. Polya (Author), John H. Conway (Foreword)

Geometry and the Imagination (AMS Chelsea Publishing) by David Hilbert (Author), S. Cohn-Vossen (Author)

Calculus Made Easy and Probability Through Problems.

Velleman's How to Prove It greatly helped my ability to construct set theoretic proofs, which better prepared me for Spivak's calculus and Baby Rudin. Hamkins' Proof and the Art of Mathematics is designed as a a good, less set-theory heavy, introduction to proof writing that leads more naturally to analysis. OpenStax books are FREE.

Rudin's Principles of Mathematical Analysis

Keith Devlin's book "Introduction to Mathematical Thinking" by Keith Devlin but for me his other book "Mathematics: The Science of Patterns" was something that really had a huge impact on me

Vector Calculus, Linear Algebra, and Differential Forms: A Unified Approach

"Real and Complex Analysis" by Rudin, and the two books both named "Calculus" from Spivak and Apostol. But also from Apostol his more concise and far-reaching "Mathematical Analysis". And from Spivak his small gem "Calculus On Manifolds" made quite a dent on me.

Street-Fighting Mathematics, by Mahajan ([http://streetfightingmath.com/](http://streetfightingmath.com/)). Intuitive, useful and fun.

Measure and Category by John Oxtoby. This book studies duality results between different notions of "small" sets in measure theory and topology. It's the first (and to some extent the only) math book where things just clicked and I didn't feel like I was drowning in a sea of notation and ideas.

_Geometry and the imagination_ by Hilbert and Cohn-Vossen

_Methods of mathematical physics_ by Courant and Hilbert

_A comprehensive introduction to differential geometry_ by Spivak (and its little brothers _Calculus_ and _Calculus on manifolds_)

_Fourier Analysis_ by Körner

_The shape of space_ by Weeks

_Solid Shape_ by Koenderink

Tristan Needhams "visual" books about complex analysis and differential forms

_Information theory, inference, and learning algorithms_ by MacKay (great book about probability, plus you can download the .tex source and read the funny comments of the author)

Thomas Garrity’s “All the mathematics you missed (but need for graduate school)”

Understanding Analysis (Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics) 2nd ed. 2015 Edition by Stephen Abbott

Invitation to Classical Analysis (Pure and Applied Undergraduate Texts) New ed. Edition by Peter Duren

Advanced Mathematical Methods for Scientists and Engineers: Asymptotic Methods and Perturbation Theory 1999th Edition by Carl M. Bender (Author), Steven A. Orszag (Author)

Numerical Linear Algebra 1st Edition by Lloyd N. Trefethen (Author), David Bau III (Author)

Algebraic Geometry: A Problem Solving Approach (Student Mathematical Library) (Student Mathematical Library: IAS/Park City Mathematical Subseries, 66)

Galois Theory Through Exercises (Springer Undergraduate Mathematics Series) 1st ed. 2018 Edition by Juliusz Brzeziński (Author)

"Concrete Mathematics: A Foundation for Computer Science" by Knuth, Graham, and Patashnik - solid foundation in mathematical concepts and techniques, and it helped me develop a deeper understanding of mathematical notation and problem-solving.

"Introduction to the Theory of Computation" by Michael Sipser - introduced me to the theoretical foundations of computer science, and it helped me develop a strong understanding of formal languages, automata, and complexity theory.

"A Course in Combinatorics" by J.H. van Lint and Wilson - provided a comprehensive introduction to combinatorics, and it helped me develop a strong understanding of combinatorial techniques and their applications.

"The Art of Problem Solving" by Richard Rusczyk - This book is a comprehensive guide to problem-solving, with a focus on mathematical problem-solving strategies. It helped me develop my problem-solving skills and learn how to think critically about mathematical problems.

Foundations and Fundamental Concepts of Mathematics by Howard Eves.(I think it might be a little dated, but it gives an amazing overview of the most important developments in mathematics that were relevant at the time. It's less focused on practice (though there are some problems) and more on the history and motivation behind the ideas. This book introduced me to axiomatics, non-Euclidean geometry, quaternions, and abstract algebra in my senior year of high-school.)

"Discrete Mathematics and Applications" by Kenneth Rosen.

_An Introduction to Category Theory_ by Harold Simmons

_Probabilistic Graphical Models_ by Koller & Friedman. In anything statistics and ML related, being able to deal with complicated probabilitistic things that are all related is really useful. This book gives you that toolkit. It's a "strong foundations" kind of book, rather than a bunch of methods you'll use directly.

1. Principles of Mathematical Analysis by Walter Rudin (baby Rudin) - I'd studied real analysis in the past, but this book is direct and rigorous and provided a good framework to move forward into things like functional analysis in a way that I was not prepared for with other books.

2. Differential Equations and Dynamical Systems by Lawrence Perko - Solidified for me how dynamic systems behaved and were solved. Very much helped my understanding of control theory as well.

3. A Concise Introduction to the Theory of Integration by Daniel Stroock - Helped solidify concepts related to Lebesgue integration and a rigorous formulation of the divergence theorem in high dimensions.

4. Convex Functional Analysis by Kurdilla and Zabarankin - Filled in a lot of random holes missing in my functional analysis knowledge. Provides a rigorous formulation of when an optimization formulation contains an infimum and whether it can be attained. Prior to this point, I often conflated the two.

A book of abstract algebra - Charles C. Pinter.

Matrix Analysis by Horn and Johnson (perhaps the best end-of-chapter problem sets of any math book I've encountered!)

Matrix Computations by Golub and Van Loan

Elements of Statistical Learning by Hastie, Friedman, Tibshirani

Functional Analysis by Reed and Simon

Differential and Integral Calculus (Volumes 1 & 2) – Nikolai Piskunov

Discrete Mathematics with Applications by Susanna S. Epp

"Fourier Series and Orthogonal Functions" by Harry S. Davis

Book of Proof by Richard Hammack. A great introduction to proofs in mathematics. The book is available free online [0], but also I bought the physical version because I really enjoyed it. [0][https://jdhsmith.math.iastate.edu/class/BookOfProof.pdf](https://jdhsmith.math.iastate.edu/class/BookOfProof.pdf)

Calculus Made Easy (1910) simply for the quote at the beginning: "What one fool can do, another can."

The Art of Probability by Hamming
Calculus by Spivak
Measurement by Lockhart
Naive Set Theory by Halmos

0. Jan Gullberg, _Mathematics, From the Birth of Numbers_. A highly accessible popular survey on different branches of higher mathematics. I read this over the Summer between high school and starting my undergraduate degree. It's what made me want to study math. Previously I'd wanted to be a guitar player, but had to find a new ambition after an injury left me unable to play.

1. The high school mathematics series by Israel Gelfand. _Algebra_, _Trigonometry_, _The Method of Coordinates_, and _Functions and Graphs_. I didn't have much mathematics background in high school, but working through these really solidified my grasp on the basics.

2. George Polya. _How to Solve it_. A short book giving excellent high level advice on mathematical problem solving.

3. George E. Andrews, _Number Theory_. I worked through this freshman year contemporaneously with my first proof based class on simple logic and set theory. A very beautiful and accessible introduction to basic number theory. The combinatorial/geometric proofs of Fermat's Little Theorem and Wilson's Theorem are lovely. It also includes a very nice proof of Chebyshev's theorem on the asymptotic density of primes and even the Rogers-Ramanujan identities for integer partitions.

4. Vladimir Arnold, _Ordinary Differential Equations_: Undergrad ODE classes are often taught in a cookbook fashion and if so, don't offer much enlightenment. This book explains what's going on at geometrical level. I didn't appreciate ODEs until I read this. See [https://www.uni-muenster.de/Physik.TP/~munsteg/arnold.html](https://www.uni-muenster.de/Physik.TP/~munsteg/arnold.html) for Arnold's views on teaching mathematics.

5. E.C. Titchmarsh _The Theory of Functions_: Recommended by my undergraduate advisor because he noticed that I liked reading older books. It contains sections on complex analysis and real analysis with measure theory, but I've only read the complex analysis sections. It's not for everyone, if I recall correctly, there is not a single picture, but it is very lively and has a lot of material you won't find in a standard complex analysis book, including Dirichlet series. Excellent as a supplement to a standard complex analysis book.

6. George Polya. _Mathematics and Plausible Reasoning_. An excellent expansion on Polya's ideas on _How to Solve it_. While the goal is to seek rigorous proofs, to get there it's powerful to be able to think based on intuition, heuristics, and plausible reasoning. A lot of math exposition is theorem/proof based and doesn't help develop these skills. In a similar vein, see also Terence Tao's classic post _There's more to mathematics than rigour and proofs_ [https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/theres-more-to-...](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/theres-more-to-mathematics-than-rigour-and-proofs/).

7. H.S.M Coxeter, _An Introduction to Geometry_. A book of very beautiful classical geometry. Something typically not touched on at all in a typical mathematics curriculum.

All the Math You Missed by Thomas A. Garrity.

Do you happen to have any on probability or statistics and or both?

- If you are trying to do inference on large datasets, I think Andrew Gelman's books are superb and will teach you invaluable skills using multi-level Stan models, i.e. generative models and Bayesian inference.
- If you want to study basic probability theory and stochastic processes, I really like _Elementary Probability Theory_ by Chung. His more advanced book is really famous, but has a measure-theoretic approach and that's not very practical unless you are interested in developing theories a bit further.
- Taleb is really fond of _Probability, Random Variables and Stochastic Processes_ by Papoulis. But I find the typesetting in later editions to be really disorganized and confusing. Take a look. It's a good alternative to the first Chung book.

Here’s a good starting point for philosophy of mathematics :
